1. What is the importance of version control in collaborative projects?

	If you mess something up, you can revert to a previous project state and figure out where the error occurred. 

2. What is the difference between staging and committing?

	Staging is when you choose which files will be updated, and committing is when you finalize the package to be sent, along with a message explaining the changes

3. What command (or button in VS Code) is used to send local commits to GitHub?

	You use the commit button to make your commits, then you use the "push" command in the terminal to submit your commits

4. How does branching help in managing multiple features in a project?

	Branching allows you to have multiple versions of a program at once, so you can test out proposed changes without altering the main file until you're certain you want to keep them.

5. What common errors did you encounter (e.g., refspec error) and how did you solve them?

	I've never used VSCode before, so I run into lots of errors, but your instructions were extremely helpful. I did run into errors because I occasionally forgot to lead with the word 'git' when using the terminal. I also have run into many errors previously in another class when I couldn't get the command 'make' to work for part of the instructions another professor gave to us. In this project, being careful to read your instructions solved every problem I had. I really appreciate how well written they were, since I have no experience with this application whatsoever, and I was able to complete the task without any issues.
